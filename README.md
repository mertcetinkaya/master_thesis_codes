The code files for my master of science thesis are given. All of them are python files and they are run in Spyder environment. In Spyder, #%% expression is used to divide a source code into cells and these cells can be run one by one. So, in the code files, this expression is used for this reason. What the code cells do and functionality of the defined functions are explained in the files using comment lines. The folder and file hierarchy explained in the master thesis must be set to run the codes properly and the parameters in the codes may be changed according to need.

About the dataset used in the thesis, 
German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark dataset can be downloaded via the link https://benchmark.ini.rub.de/gtsrb_news.html
Belgium Traffic Sign Classification dataset can be downloaded via the link https://btsd.ethz.ch/shareddata/
